If you have a very unique face, you will be more confident. It's harder to solve photos with a bad angle.","I solved it by looking at the shape of the face (oval, egg-shaped). Some questions I got confused by the pixelated photos, and others I solved because the other three out of four choices were too different, so I realized it was either an OX problem or a subjective one."

605,"명암 없이 완전한 흑백으로 이루어진 사진과 점의 개수가 적을수록 어려웠습니다. 인식할 때는 앞머리와 턱의 모양을 중점으로 보고 귀와 코 위치를 세부적으로 봤습니다. 상대적인 귀 위치에 따른 코 길이로 턱이 비슷하게 생긴 사람을 구분했습니다. 동일한 인물들이 계속 나와서 뒤로 갈수록 얼굴 점선의 특정짓는 윤곽을 기억하기 보다 실제 이미지측 남자를 기억하며 생각이 굳어졌습니다. 혼자 머릿속으로 ‘앞머리 없는 남자,’ ‘턱이 뾰족한 남자,’ ‘머리가 풍성한 아주머니,’ 이렇게 이름지어 점선 이미지를 보고 바로 특정 그분을 찾으려 했습니다.","It was more difficult with photos that were completely black and white with no contrast and fewer dots. When recognizing, I focused on the shape of the bangs and chin and looked closely at the ear and nose positions. I distinguished between people with similar chins by the length of their noses in relation to the position of their ears. As I kept seeing the same people over and over again, I found myself remembering the actual man in the image rather than remembering the specific outlines of the dotted lines on his face.

606,"생각보다 난이도가 꽤 어렵다고 느껴지네요. 비장애인인 저조차도 확신이 안가는 문제가 40% 정도 되는 것 같습니다. 인식할 때 얼굴형 등 윤곽에 집중했고, 헤어스타일도 큰 단서가 됐습니다. 옆모습을 보여줄 때 더 어렵게 느껴졌구요. binary image는 거의 찍다시피 풀었습니다. grayscale을더 크게 해줘야 인식을 잘 할 것 같습니다. 이미지의 channel을 너무 작게 줄여버린건 단서가 적어 풀기 힘들었습니다. 실험 시간이 생각보다 길고, 문제수가 많아 피로도가 쌓입니다. 이는 실험자의 정답률에 안좋은 영향을 끼칠 것이라 사려됩니다. 추후실험에서는 난이도를 낮추고 (픽셀, 선명도 등 up), 문제수를 적게 하면 더 좋은 결과가 나올 것 같아요. 총평: 어렵다!","I feel that the difficulty level is quite higher than I thought. I think there are about 40% of the problems that even I, a non-disabled person, am not sure about. I focused on the contours of the face when recognizing, and the hairstyle was also a big clue. It was more difficult when showing the side view. I solved the binary image almost as soon as I took it. I think I need to make the grayscale bigger to recognize it better. Reducing the channel of the image too small gave fewer clues and made it harder to solve. The experiment was longer than expected, and the number of questions was high, which led to fatigue, which may have a negative effect on the correct answer rate. In future experiments, I think it would be better to lower the difficulty level (increase pixels, sharpness, etc.) and reduce the number of questions.
